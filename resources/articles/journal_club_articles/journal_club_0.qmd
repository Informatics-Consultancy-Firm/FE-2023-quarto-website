**Contribution and quality of mathematical modeling evidence in World Health Organization guidelines: A systematic review**

#### Guiding Questions

1. Modeling-informed recommendations were more likely to be conditional (versus strong), and to be based on evidence that was assessed as lower quality. Why might this be?  
2. How does reporting model limitations and assumptions affect trust in model validity?  
3. How does the use of mathematical modeling differ for infectious disease vs other disease guidelines?
