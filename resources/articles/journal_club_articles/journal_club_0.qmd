**Contribution and quality of mathematical modeling evidence in World Health Organization guidelines: A systematic review**

#### Guiding Questions


1. What are the benefits and limitations of using mathematical modeling studies to guide global health policy?

2. How can policymakers ensure that mathematical modeling studies are conducted and reported in a transparent and rigorous manner?  

3. What ethical considerations should be taken into account when using mathematical modeling studies to inform policy decisions?  

4. How can stakeholders with different perspectives (e.g., scientists, policymakers, patients) collaborate effectively to incorporate mathematical modeling evidence into guidelines?  

5. What are some potential areas for future research in this field?
