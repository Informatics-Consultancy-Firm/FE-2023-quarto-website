**Seasonality and heterogeneity of malaria transmission determine success of interventions in high-endemic settings: a modeling study**

### Guiding Questions

1. How does the seasonality and heterogeneity of malaria transmission impact the success of intervention strategies in high-endemic settings?  
2. What are some challenges in accurately capturing the realistic seasonality of vector abundance and within-host effects in mathematical models of malaria transmission?  
3. What are some potential limitations of using seasonal measurements of parasite densities in multiple age groups to determine seasonality of malaria exposure when entomological data is unavailable?  
4. How can a better understanding of the seasonality and heterogeneity of malaria transmission contribute to designing effective and efficient strategies for continued control and possibly elimination?
