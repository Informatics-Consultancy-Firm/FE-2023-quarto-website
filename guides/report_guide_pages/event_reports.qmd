⚠️ How-To: report on broadcast events that occur during simulations


EMOD is capable of tracking a variety of [built-in events](https://docs.idmod.org/projects/emod-malaria/en/latest/parameter-campaign-event-list.html) as well as custom campaign events. Custom events can be particularly useful for explicitly tracking and counting the number of interventions distributed. For example, in the simple SMC intervention (see [add drug campaigns how to](https://docs.idmod.org/projects/emodpy-malaria/en/latest/emodpy_malaria.interventions.drug_campaign.html)) we defined an event called `'Received_SMC'` to describe children who actually received SMC drugs in the simulation. The [`add_treatment_seeking`](https://docs.idmod.org/projects/emodpy-malaria/en/latest/emodpy_malaria.interventions.treatment_seeking.html) function automatically generates a `'Received_Treatment'` event for each individual receiving treatment for symptomatic malaria. Adding custom events to the config parameter `'Custom_Individual_Events'` is automatically handled by `emodpy` during campaign creation.

# Aggregate Events - ReportEventCounter

To track how many events are occurring each day, request [`ReportEventCounter`](https://docs.idmod.org/projects/emod-malaria/en/latest/software-report-event-counter.html) with [`add_report_event_counter()`](https://docs.idmod.org/projects/emodpy-malaria/en/latest/emodpy_malaria.reporters.builtin.html#emodpy_malaria.reporters.builtin.add_report_event_counter) and specify the list of events you would like to track, in this case receiving either of the two above drug-based interventions:

```{python}
from emodpy_malaria.reporters.builtin import *

sim_years = 5
add_report_event_counter(task, manifest, start_day=365, end_day=sim_years*365,
                             event_trigger_list=['Received_SMC', 'Received_Treatment'],
                             filename_suffix="drug_interventions")
```

This generates a ReportEventCounter.json file that reports that total number of the specified events in each day of the simulation. Reporting a subset of node IDs (`node_ids`), restricting on age (`min_age_years`, `max_age_years`), and restricting on individual property (`must_have_ip_key_value`) are all configurable. The format of the .json is identical to InsetChart.json, so analyzers written for InsetChart.json can be easily adapted for `ReportEventCounter`.

# Individual Events - ReportEventRecorder

Sometimes you may want to track individual-level events. To do so, we use [`add_event_recorder()`](https://github.com/numalariamodeling/emodpy-malaria/blob/main/emodpy_malaria/reporters/builtin.py) to call the  [`ReportEventRecorder`](https://docs.idmod.org/projects/emod-malaria/en/latest/software-report-event-recorder.html), which is similar to `ReportEventCounter` but lists each event as it occurs and provides information about the person experiencing the event. The calls for these two reports are quite similar but the recorder uses `event_list` rather than `event_trigger_list` and has no `filename_suffix`:

```{python}
from emodpy_malaria.reporters.builtin import *

sim_years = 5
add_event_recorder(task, start_day=365, end_day=sim_years*365,
                       event_list=['Received_SMC', 'Received_Treatment'],
                       node_ids=[1], min_age_years=0,
                       max_age_years=100)
```

*Note*: If you want to return all events from the simulation, leave the "events" array empty and set `only_include_events_in_list` to `False`.

After running, a file called ReportEventRecorder.csv will be generated in the output/ folder for the simulation. Each row of the report represents a distinct event, with the following information in its columns:

Event Details:
- **Time** (when did event occur)
- **Node_ID** (where did event occur)
- **Event_Name** (what happened)

Individual Details (who did it happen to?):
- **Individual_ID**
- **Age**
- **Gender**
- **Infected** (1 = True)
- **Infectiousness**
- **RelativeBitingRate**
- **TrueParasiteDensity**
- **TrueGametocyteDensity**
- **HasClinicalSymptoms**

Plus an additional column for the value of any IPs requested through `ips_to_record`.

You can include additional customization following the [documentation](https://docs.idmod.org/projects/emodpy-malaria/en/latest/emodpy_malaria.reporters.builtin.html#emodpy_malaria.reporters.builtin.add_event_recorder)
