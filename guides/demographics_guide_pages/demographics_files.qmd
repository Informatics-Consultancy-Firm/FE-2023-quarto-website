# Create a Demographics Files 

The demographics file is a required input file for EMOD that specifies characteristics of the population in a simulation. This includes aspects like the population size, birth rates, non-malaria mortality rates, age structure, initial prevalence, and more. Full documentation on the [demographics file](https://docs.idmod.org/projects/emod-malaria/en/latest/software-demographics.html) and its [parameters/structure](https://docs.idmod.org/projects/emod-malaria/en/latest/parameter-demographics.html) are available in the malaria model documentation.

## Parts of a demographics file

A demographics file is a JSON file organized into 4 main sections:

1.  Metadata
2.  NodeProperties
3.  Defaults
    -   Parameters applied to all nodes in the simulation
4.  Nodes: each node is a simulated location. Transmission within a node is well-mixed, and nodes are connected by human and/or vector migration.
    -   Allows node-specific parameters
    -   Specified parameters override values in 'Defaults'

```python
# Structure of Demographics File for a simulation with 1 node
  {
     "Metadata": {
          "DateCreated": "dateTime",
          "Tool": "scriptUsedToGenerate",
          "Author": "author",
          "IdReference": "Gridded world grump2.5arcmin",
          "NodeCount": "1"
     },
     "NodeProperties": [
          {...}
     ],
     "Defaults": {
          "NodeAttributes": {
            ...
            "BirthRateSource": "World Bank",
            "CountryBirthRate": 31.047,
            "World Bank Year": "2016",
            ...
          },
          "IndividualAttributes": {...},
          "IndividualProperties": {...}
     },
     "Nodes": [{
          "NodeID": 1,
          "NodeAttributes": {
            "BirthRate": 0.1190,
            "InitialPopulation": 1400,
            "Village": "Obom"
          },
          "IndividualAttributes": {...},
          "IndividualProperties": {...}
     }]
  }
```

## Single-node simulations

The [emod-api](https://docs.idmod.org/projects/emod-api/en/latest/emod_api.demographics.html) package contains most of the major functionality to create a demographics file. It is supported by `emodpy-malaria` to add parameters that are more specific to the malaria workflow, imported as [`Demographics`](https://docs.idmod.org/projects/emodpy-malaria/en/latest/emodpy_malaria.demographics.MalariaDemographics.html/github.com/numalariamodeling/emodpy-malaria/blob/main/emodpy_malaria/demographics/MalariaDemographics.py) in the code chunk below. For single node, non-spatial simulations the [`from_template_node`](https://docs.idmod.org/projects/emodpy-malaria/en/latest/emodpy_malaria.demographics.MalariaDemographics.html#emodpy_malaria.demographics.MalariaDemographics.from_template_node) command is most commonly used; however, you may also choose to read in pre-made json files for these types of simulations. We include this command in our demographics builder with it's basic parameters:
    - latitude
    - longitude
    - population size
    - site name
    - forced node ID (if desired)
    - initial prevalence value (if desired)
    
With this saved as the `demog` item, we can add additional complexity as needed. This may include things like setting equilibrium vital dynamics so birth and mortality rates are equal, producing a relatively stable population size, or an age distribution for our population. In this example, we pull the [age distribution](https://github.com/numalariamodeling/emod-api/blob/master/emod_api/demographics/PreDefinedDistributions.py) of all of Sub-Saharan Africa from the `emod-api` and then apply it to our demographics item. You may also add complexity through individual properties and other specific parameters as desired.

```{python, eval=F}
import emodpy_malaria.demographics.MalariaDemographics as Demographics
import emod_api.demographics.PreDefinedDistributions as Distributions

def build_demog():
    """
    This function builds a demographics input file for the DTK using emod_api.
    """

    demog = Demographics.from_template_node(lat=1.00, lon=1.00, pop=1000, name="Example_Site_Name", forced_id=1, init_prev=0.1)
    
    # Add equal birth and mortality rates
    demog.SetEquilibriumVitalDynamics()
    
    # Call and add age distribution
    age_distribution = Distributions.AgeDistribution_SSAfrica
    demog.SetAgeDistribution(age_distribution)

    return demog
```
