ITNs with different usage patterns

# Bednets (ITNs)

Insecticide-treated bednets can be distributed with the [`add_itn_scheduled()`](https://github.com/numalariamodeling/emodpy-malaria/blob/main/emodpy_malaria/interventions/bednet.py) function, which has many options to configure who is targeted for ITN distribution. The scheduled distribution is particularly useful for distribution campaigns, while a similar function, `add_itn_triggered()` is necessary for distribution tied to events, such as births.

```{python,eval=F}
import emod_api.campaign as campaign
from emodpy_malaria.interventions.bednet import add_itn_scheduled
add_itn_scheduled(campaign,
        start=365, # starts on first day of second year
        coverage_by_ages=[
          {"coverage":1,"min": 0, "max": 10},     # 100% for 0-10 years old
          {"coverage":0.75,"min": 10, "max": 50}, # 75% for 10-50 years old
          {"coverage":0.6,"min": 50, "max": 125}  # 60% for everyone else
        ],
        repetitions=5, # ITN will be distributed 5 times
        timesteps_between_repetitions= 365*3 # three years between ITN distributions
)

                      killing_box_duration: int = 0,
                      killing_decay_time_constant: float = 7300,
                      repelling_initial_effect: float = 0,
                      repelling_box_duration: float = -1,
                      repelling_decay_time_constant: float = 0,
                      usage_initial_effect: float = 1,
                      usage_box_duration: float = -1,
                      usage_decay_time_constant: float = 0,
                      insecticide: str = "",
                      cost: float = 0,
                      intervention_name: str = "SimpleBednet")
```

The default `coverage_by_age` sets coverage to 100% for everyone regardless of age.
