    "text": "Git is a popular version control software to manage codes, especially in a collaborative environment.\nHere is a comic from “Piled Higher and Deeper” by Jorge Cham regarding version control:\n Git allows us to make changes to our code, and say if we didn’t like the changes, we can always go back to the older versions of the code. In a collaborative environment, our colleagues can make changes to our codes, and we can track who’s made what changes to the code, and undo it if necessary. If all of these sounds familiar, yes it does feel like we that track changes function in say Microsoft Word, or the version control function available in Dropbox. The difference is that you can designate a folder as your “Git repository”, and you decide which file inside this folder get version controlled.\nWhile Git is a software that lives inside your computer, GitHub is an internet hosting provider that can host your Git repository. For example, a git repository containing the dtk-tools Python package is hosted on GitHub. This package is important for us to use EMOD, and is developed by IDM. To obtain the package, we can (1) get granted access to the repository that lives in GitHub, and (2) “clone” the package from GitHub to our local computer. We can then look into the package and find out who has made what changes to the source code of the package. This has made it very easy for coding projects and packages to be shared to others.\nGit can get complicated and difficult to use at times… However, in this section, we focus only on the simple steps of getting the packages to your computer.\n\nThings you’ll need\n\nInstall GitHub Desktop\nGet a GitHub account if you don’t already have.\nGet the access to the repository dtk-tools and dtk-tools-malaria if you don’t already have them\n\n\n\nGitHub Desktop\nThis is an app that provides graphic user interface to GitHub. Note that you do not necessarily need to use this app to interface with Git or GitHub. There are other app such as Sourcetree or commandline that does similar and wonderful job. However for this tutorial, we use GitHub Desktop because it’s easier to set things up.\nTo “download” the package, we “Clone repository” from GitHub, which can be access from “File” at the top bar. If you already connected your GitHub account to the app, you should be able to choose the dtk-tools repository in the pop-up window. Then you would specify a “Local path” of your choice (you do not need to add “dtk-tools” to that path.) When you click “Clone”, the app would download the package into a folder called dtk-tools and put it onto the path you specified.\nDo the same thing for dtk-tools-malaria!\n\n\nMore Git?\nOf course, there are more to git than what we have just done. During the tutorial, some of the basic function of git, such as commit, push and pull will be demonstrated. These functions will be important when you start developing your own project. Depending on what software you use to code (e.g., PyCharm, VS Code), git functions are often incorporated into them already, so the experience is bound to be slightly different.\nIf you’re planning to use git through command line (e.g., Powershell, Bash etc.) then this is a good tutorial for you to learn more about git."

Participants will design their own research question and focal training project using EMOD that will form the basis of a Specific Aims page (grant proposal summary page) to be developed during the program.\n\n\nProgram Highlights\n\nMulti-modal training in applied malaria modeling\nHands-on tutorials and exercises focused on model configuration and analysis, supplemented by lectures and journal clubs, to enable participants to independently carry out their focal projects. Participants will run models on Northwestern’s high performance computing cluster.\n\n\nTraining in written and oral scientific communication\nIterative revisions of written Specific Aims and oral presentations, with feedback from program director, peers, and other Northwestern modelers.\n\n\nDedicated mentorship\nWeekly 1-on-1 meetings with program director and an assigned partner from Northwestern’s team of modelers.\n\n\nBuilding connections with a global community of malaria modelers\nMembership and participation in the Applied Malaria Modeling Network (AMMnet); connections with faculty enrichment program alumni; attendance at the American Society of Tropical Medicine & Hygiene (ASTMH) 2023 Annual Meeting in Chicago"

We will hold (virtual) Office Hours in Week 0 to answer questions and troubleshoot problems if you get stuck while working on it.\n\nPart 0. Get a copy of the example data\n\nGo to the coding assignment repository\nObtain a local copy of the example_data/ folder\nOption 1: Git clone the repository to a new folder on your computer, …/project_dir\nOption 2: Download and unzip the folder to a new folder on your computer, …/project_dir\nExamine a sample output.csv file from the example data.\nYou will have to click through experiment > simulation_## > outputs to see one. This is a standard directory structure for outputs from the model, EMOD, which you will soon become very familiar with!\n\nIn reality, this output file is produced as a .json dictionary, which can be thought of as a pandas DataFrame. However, to make the assignment simpler, we’ve created “fake” output files that already in a form that is easier to work with.\nEach output.csv file contains daily timeseries corresponding to a simulation with a unique combination of the parameters:\n\nTreatment_Rate: probability that uncomplicated malaria cases seek (and receive) treatment with Artemether-Lumefantrine.\nRun_Number: random “seed” adding stochastic variation between simulations with otherwise identical parameters.\n\n\n\n\n\nPart 1. Python - analyze example data\n\nCreate a new my_script.py file in the same /project_dir where you saved the example_data folder\nYour directory structure should be:\n\nproject_dir/\n\nexample_data/\n\n…\n\nmy_script.py\n\n\nImport the following modules: pandas, numpy\nCombine data from the output.csv file in each example_data/simulation/ sub-folder into a single DataFrame, with the following modifications:\n\nGroup by Day, Run_Number, and Treatment_Rate\nRestrict to include only values in the last 365 Days\nSave the values for “Blood_Smear_Parasite_Prevalence”, “PCR_Parasite_Prevalence” and “PfHRP2_Prevalence” in each group\n\nDo not save the values for any other variables that may have been in output.csv !\n\nAppend to results from all simulations together.\n\nSave the resulting DataFrame as output_cleaned.csv\n\n\n\nPart 2. R - transform and visualize output\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDid you generate the output from Part 1?\n\n\n\nThis must be done before starting Part 2.\nYour directory structure should now be:\n\nproject_dir/\n\nexample_data/\n\n…\n\nmy_script.py\noutput_cleaned.csv\n\n\n\n\n\nOpen Rstudio: File > New Project > Existing Directory > project_dir\nCreate a new .Rmd file or .R script inside project_dir to do the following:\n\nRead in output_cleaned.csv\nAggregate the mean prevalence by Blood Smear, PCR, and PfHRP2 (separately) on each day for a given Treatment_Rate\nUse ggplot2 to produce plots of the timeseries\n\nTime on the x-axis, prevalence on the y-axis\nSeparate lines and colors for each value of Treatment_Rate\nSeparate facets/panels/plots for each diagnostic (PCR, Blood Smear, and PfHRP2)\nAn informative title, labels, legend, color palette etc.\n\nYou don’t need to spend much time on plot appearance for this for this assignment, but it is an important part of communicating our findings\n\n\nSave your plot(s) as .png file(s) in project_dir/ with an informative filename (ex. “prevalence_by_treatment_rate.png”\n\n\n\n\nPart 3. Git - add files to your own branch"
