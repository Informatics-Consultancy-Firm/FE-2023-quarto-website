Regular analysis and use of public health data will lead to more effective control through evidence-based decision making.\nOur long-term goal is to train a critical mass of modeling scientists who are:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1. Retained within Sub-Saharan Africa\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2. Training the next generation of modelers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.

Competitive in obtaining grants from international funding agencies\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5. Closely networked with each other across Africa and with international partners\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo help achieve this goal, Northwestern University’s malaria modeling team is offering an 18-week intensive in-person training program in applied malaria modeling for Sub-Saharan African mathematical modeling faculty - with or without public health backgrounds - tailored to their experience and needs.\nTraining is focused on applied modeling with EMOD, an open-source malaria transmission modeling software that is currently used to support malaria programs. Participants will design their own research question and focal training project using EMOD that will form the basis of a Specific Aims page (grant proposal summary page) to be developed during the program."

    "text": "⚠️ How-To: report on broadcast events that occur during simulations\nEMOD is capable of tracking a variety of built-in events as well as custom campaign events. Custom events can be particularly useful for explicitly tracking and counting the number of interventions distributed. For example, in the simple SMC intervention (see How-To on drug campaigns) we defined an event called 'Received_SMC' to describe children who actually received SMC drugs in the simulation. The add_health_seeking function automatically generates a 'Received_Treatment' event for each individual receiving treatment for symptomatic malaria. Adding custom events to the config parameter 'Custom_Individual_Events' is handled automatically.\n\nReportEventCounter\nTo track how many events are occurring each day, request ReportEventCounter and specify the list of events you would like to track:\n# Example\nThis generates a ReportEventCounter.json file that reports that total number of events in each day of the simulation. Reporting a subset of node IDs, restricting on age, and restricing on individual property are all configurable. The format of the .json is identical to InsetChart.json, so analyzers written for InsetChart.json can be easily adapted for ReportEventCounter.\n\n\nReportEventRecorder\nSometimes you may want to track individual-level events. To do so, we use ReportEventRecorder, which is similar to ReportEventCounter but lists each event as it occurs and provides information about the person experiencing the event.\n\nUpdate configuration parameters\n#Example\n\nThere are additional optional parameters that you can specify to refine your report: see full list here. This can help reduce file sizes and speed up processing if you know you’ll only a subset of the simulation data.\nAfter running, a file called ReportEventRecorder.csv will be generated in the output/ folder for the simulation. Each row of the report represents a distinct event, with the following information in its columns:\n\nEvent Details:\n\nTime (when did event occur)\nNode_ID (where did event occur)\nEvent_Name (what happened)\n\nIndividual Details (who did it happen to?):\n\nIndividual_ID\nAge\nGender\nInfected (1 = True)\nInfectiousness\nRelativeBitingRate\nTrueParasiteDensity\nTrueGametocyteDensity\nPlus an additional column for the value of each additional Individual Property included in the 'Report_Event_Recorder_Individual_Properties' list."

    "text": "Mission\nMalaria burden remains high in Sub-Saharan Africa despite two decades of intense intervention. Regular analysis and use of public health data will lead to more effective control through evidence-based decision making.\nOur long-term goal is to train a critical mass of modeling scientists who are:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1. Retained within Sub-Saharan Africa\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2. Training the next generation of modelers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3. Working closely with local malaria control programs to provide operational support\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4. Competitive in obtaining grants from international funding agencies\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5. Closely networked with each other across Africa and with international partners\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo help achieve this goal, Northwestern University’s malaria modeling team is offering an 18-week intensive in-person training program in applied malaria modeling for Sub-Saharan African mathematical modeling faculty - with or without public health backgrounds - tailored to their experience and needs.\nTraining is focused on applied modeling with EMOD, an open-source malaria transmission modeling software that is currently used to support malaria programs. Participants will design their own research question and focal training project using EMOD that will form the basis of a Specific Aims page (grant proposal summary page) to be developed during the program.\n\n\nProgram Highlights\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMulti-modal training in applied malaria modeling\n\n\n\nHands-on tutorials and exercises focused on model configuration and analysis, supplemented by lectures and journal clubs, to enable participants to independently carry out their focal projects. Participants will run models using Northwestern’s high performance computing cluster.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTraining in written and oral scientific communication\n\n\n\nIterative revisions of draft documents and oral presentations, with feedback from program director, peers, and other Northwestern modelers.\n\nProject Specific Aims page\nNIH-Style Investigator “Biosketch”\n3 Research Talks (Project Proposal, Work-in-Progress, and Final Presentation)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDedicated mentorship\n\n\n\nWeekly 1-on-1 meetings with program director and an assigned partner from Northwestern’s team of modelers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBuilding connections with a global community of malaria modelers\n\n\n\n\nJoin and participation in the Applied Malaria Modeling Network (AMMnet)\n\nConnect with faculty enrichment program alumni\nAttend the American Society of Tropical Medicine & Hygiene (ASTMH) 2023 Annual Meeting in Chicago, and the AMMnet Pre-ASTMH Modeling Meeting"

We will hold (virtual) Office Hours in Week 0 to answer questions and troubleshoot problems if you get stuck while working on it.\n\nPart 0. Get a copy of the example data\n\nGo to the coding assignment repository\nObtain a local copy of the example_data/ folder\n\nDownload and unzip the folder to a new folder on your computer, …/project_dir\n\nExamine a sample output.csv file from the example data.\nYou will have to click through experiment > simulation_## > outputs to see one. This is a standard directory structure for outputs from the model, EMOD, which you will soon become very familiar with!\n\nIn reality, this output file is produced as a .json dictionary, which can be thought of as a pandas DataFrame. However, to make the assignment simpler, we’ve created “fake” output files that already in a form that is easier to work with.\nEach output.csv file contains daily timeseries corresponding to a simulation with a unique combination of the parameters:\n\nTreatment_Rate: probability that uncomplicated malaria cases seek (and receive) treatment with Artemether-Lumefantrine.\nRun_Number: random “seed” adding stochastic variation between simulations with otherwise identical parameters.\n\n\n\n\n\nPart 1. Python - analyze example data\n\nCreate a new my_script.py file in the same /project_dir where you saved the example_data folder\nYour directory structure should be:\n\nproject_dir/\n\nexample_data/\n\n…\n\nmy_script.py\n\n\nImport the following modules: pandas, numpy\nCombine data from the output.csv file in each example_data/simulation/ sub-folder into a single DataFrame, with the following modifications:\n\nGroup by Day, Run_Number, and Treatment_Rate\nRestrict to include only values in the last 365 Days\nSave the values for “Blood_Smear_Parasite_Prevalence”, “PCR_Parasite_Prevalence” and “PfHRP2_Prevalence” in each group\n\nDo not save the values for any other variables that may have been in output.csv !\n\nAppend to results from all simulations together.\n\nSave the resulting DataFrame as output_cleaned.csv\n\n\n\nPart 2. R - transform and visualize output\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDid you generate the output from Part 1?\n\n\n\nThis must be done before starting Part 2.\nYour directory structure should now be:\n\nproject_dir/\n\nexample_data/\n\n…\n\nmy_script.py\noutput_cleaned.csv\n\n\n\n\n\nOpen Rstudio: File > New Project > Existing Directory > project_dir\nCreate a new .Rmd file or .R script inside project_dir to do the following:\n\nRead in output_cleaned.csv\nAggregate the mean prevalence by Blood Smear, PCR, and PfHRP2 (separately) on each day for a given Treatment_Rate\nUse ggplot2 to produce plots of the data:\n\nTime on the x-axis, prevalence on the y-axis\nSeparate lines and colors for each value of Treatment_Rate\nSeparate facets/panels/sub-plots for each diagnostic (PCR, Blood Smear, and PfHRP2)\nAn informative title, labels, legend, color palette etc.\n\nYou don’t need to spend much time on plot appearance for this for this assignment, but it is an important part of communicating our findings\n\n\nSave your plot(s) as .png file(s) in project_dir/ with an informative file name (ex. “prevalence_by_treatment_rate.png”)\n\n\n\n\nPart 3. Submit to Slack\nPost your plot(s) to the slack channel for feedback.\n\nHow does it compare to others?\nIf something looks off, what do you think is causing it?"

    "text": "Git is a popular version control software to manage codes, especially in a collaborative environment.\nHere is a comic from “Piled Higher and Deeper” by Jorge Cham regarding version control:\n Git allows us to make changes to our code, and say if we didn’t like the changes, we can always go back to the older versions of the code. In a collaborative environment, our colleagues can make changes to our codes, and we can track who’s made what changes to the code, and undo it if necessary. If all of these sounds familiar, yes it does feel like we that track changes function in say Microsoft Word, or the version control function available in Dropbox. The difference is that you can designate a folder as your “Git repository”, and you decide which file inside this folder get version controlled.\nWhile Git is a software that lives inside your computer, GitHub is an internet hosting provider that can host your Git repository. For example, a git repository containing the dtk-tools Python package is hosted on GitHub. This package is important for us to use EMOD, and is developed by IDM. To obtain the package, we can (1) get granted access to the repository that lives in GitHub, and (2) “clone” the package from GitHub to our local computer. We can then look into the package and find out who has made what changes to the source code of the package. This has made it very easy for coding projects and packages to be shared to others.\nGit can get complicated and difficult to use at times… However, in this section, we focus only on the simple steps of getting the packages to your computer.\n\nThings you’ll need\n\nInstall GitHub Desktop\nGet a GitHub account if you don’t already have.\nGet the access to the repository dtk-tools and dtk-tools-malaria if you don’t already have them\n\n\n\nGitHub Desktop\nThis is an app that provides graphic user interface to GitHub. Note that you do not necessarily need to use this app to interface with Git or GitHub. There are other app such as Sourcetree or commandline that does similar and wonderful job. However for this tutorial, we use GitHub Desktop because it’s easier to set things up.\nTo “download” the package, we “Clone repository” from GitHub, which can be access from “File” at the top bar. If you already connected your GitHub account to the app, you should be able to choose the dtk-tools repository in the pop-up window. Then you would specify a “Local path” of your choice (you do not need to add “dtk-tools” to that path.) When you click “Clone”, the app would download the package into a folder called dtk-tools and put it onto the path you specified.\nDo the same thing for dtk-tools-malaria!\n\n\nMore Git?\nOf course, there are more to git than what we have just done. During the tutorial, some of the basic function of git, such as commit, push and pull will be demonstrated. These functions will be important when you start developing your own project. Depending on what software you use to code (e.g., PyCharm, VS Code), git functions are often incorporated into them already, so the experience is bound to be slightly different.\nIf you’re planning to use git through command line (e.g., Powershell, Bash etc.) then this is a good tutorial for you to learn more about git."

Often we have maps showing values for each pixels, for example, ITN access and usage map with 5km x 5km resolutions or Population counts with 1km x 1km resolutions. To convert these maps to useful estimates for our model, we need to extract the values underlying each pixel in the map, within the geographical area of interest. For example, if the map covers the entire Sub-Saharan Africa, and all we need is values from Burkina Faso, we will need to only extract the pixels within the country’s boundary. Then we would need to aggregate the values of the pixels, to obtain some form of country-wide estimate. Similar analogy is applicable to region, district and province.\nWe use the sp and raster packages in R to achieve this. For the first example, we will walk through extracting ITN usage estimate for a Burkina Faso district of Kampti."

There are a little misalignment in the north for this raster, but for our purpose, this problem is not too big.\n\nplot(pop_raster)\nplot(shp, add=T)\n\n\n\n\n\nNaïve Extraction\nThe most naïve way of extracting values for each district here is to directly use the extract() function. When supplied with a set of polygons (shapes), the function pull the values underlying all the pixels within the shapes, and aggregate them, say by taking means. The function can be supplied by a set of points too.\n\ndf <- shp@data # Pull data out of shapefiles (District names etc.)\n\n# Extract and aggregate using mean function\ndf$itn_cov <- extract(itn_raster, shp, fun=mean)\n\n# Look at values for Bittou district\ndf[df$NOMDEP=='BITTOU', c('NOMDEP', 'NOMREGION', 'itn_cov')]\n\n   NOMDEP  NOMREGION   itn_cov\n53 BITTOU CENTRE-EST 0.7512201\n\n\n\n\nPopulation-weighted extraction\nSometimes averaging each pixel without weights doesn’t feel quite “right”: Pixels inside uninhabited forests aren’t the same as pixels inside a crowded town when we care about ITN coverage. Therefore, we may elect to use population map to weight the pixels and obtain a population-weighted estimate for each district.\n\n# First try to stack the ITN and Population map\n## To do so, need to ensure two maps cover same area\n## Crop ITN raster according to Population raster\nitn_raster_cr <- crop(itn_raster, pop_raster)\n## Lower resolution of Population raster to the level of ITN raster\npop_raster_res <- resample(pop_raster, itn_raster_cr, )\n\n## Stacking the raster\nitn_pop_stack <- stack(itn_raster_cr, pop_raster_res)\n\n# Extract the raster stack according to the shapes, no aggregation\nout <- extract(itn_pop_stack, shp)\n\n# Define functions to calculate weighted average from output matrix\nweighted_avg <- function (x, w) sum(x * w) / sum(w)\nestim_from_matrix <- function (mat) {\n  mat <- na.omit(mat)\n  return(weighted_avg(mat[,1], mat[,2]))\n}\n\nWithout specifying the aggregating function for extract(), the function pull every single pixel out of the raster stack. Result is a list of matrices, first column is ITN coverage, second column is population count. So we define a function estim_from_matrix() that would calculate weighted average of first column according to second column. sapply() applies the function to each element (matrix) of the list, and combine the output nicely into a vector.\n\ndf2 <- shp@data\ndf2$itn_cov <- sapply(out, estim_from_matrix)\n\ndf2[df2$NOMDEP=='BITTOU', c('NOMDEP', 'NOMREGION', 'itn_cov')]\n\n   NOMDEP  NOMREGION   itn_cov\n53 BITTOU CENTRE-EST 0.7475682\n\n\nThe ITN coverage estimates from population-weighted method is almost the same as the naive method. This is potentially due to the ITN estimates within the district being relatively homogeneous."
