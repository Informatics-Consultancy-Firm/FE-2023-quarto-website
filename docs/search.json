Closely networked with each other across Africa and with international partners\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo help achieve this goal, Northwestern University’s malaria modeling team is offering an 18-week intensive in-person training program in applied malaria modeling for Sub-Saharan African mathematical modeling faculty - with or without public health backgrounds - tailored to their experience and needs.\nTraining is focused on applied modeling with EMOD, an open-source malaria transmission modeling software that is currently used to support malaria programs. Participants will design their own research question and focal training project using EMOD that will form the basis of a Specific Aims page (grant proposal summary page) to be developed during the program."

Full documentation on the demographics file can be found here.\nAt least one demographics file is required for every simulation unless you set the parameter Enable_Demographics_Builtin to 1 (one) in the configuration file. This setting does not represent a real location and is generally only used for testing and validating code.\nFor many applications, users often will reuse a standard demographics file and make modifications by hand or by script.

The following instructions are specific to QUEST but can easily be adapted to other clusters or HPCs that use SLURM scheduling. There are existing virtual environments (one for SLURM_BRIDGE, emodpy_b, and one for SLURM_LOCAL, emodpy_alt) that are up-to-date on b1139 and available for team use. If choosing to use these it is recommended that you set up an alias in your .bashrc file for ease of access, but otherwise require no installation. However, if you would like to use your own virtual environment or version of emodpy/idmtools you can use these to setup on your home directory.\n\n\n\nReview prerequisites and recommendations.\n\nhttps://docs.idmod.org/projects/idmtools/en/latest/platforms/slurm/index.html#prerequisites\nhttps://docs.idmod.org/projects/idmtools/en/latest/platforms/slurm/index.html#recommendations\n\nLogin/SSH to Slurm cluster (QUEST). You can either use FastX or directly SSH from terminal prompt, like the following:\nssh –X <usernamehere>@quest.northwestern.edu \nLoad Python module 3.8.4, at terminal prompt, type the following:\n\nNOTE: idmtools requires Python 3.7 or higher. This is the reason for loading Python 3.8.4, which is available on QUEST; however, QUEST currently defaults to Python 3.6.x.\n\nmodule load python/3.8.4\nPull Singularity image containing Python and MPI (used by emodpy-malaria tasks)\n\nNOTE: this sif file already exists in /projects/b1139/images/dtk_run_rocky_py39.sif and does not need to be reinstalled if you have access to the project\n\ncurl https://packages.idmod.org:443/artifactory/idm-docker-public/idmtools/rocky_mpi/dtk_run_rocky_py39.sif -o dtk_run_rocky_py39.sif\n\n\n\n\n\nThe preferred method of installation is to use a Singularity image, where you first load a module and then pull an idmtools image:\n\nNOTE: this sif file already exists in /projects/b1139/images/emodpy-malaria_2.4.3e.sif and does not need to be reinstalled if you have access to the project\n\nmodule load singularity \n\nsingularity pull docker://idm-docker-public.packages.idmod.org/emodpy/emodpy-malaria:2.4.3e \n\nNOTE: If you chose not to use Singularity, see (Alternative) Install in virtual environment\n\nThen you must create a Python virtual environment, unload Python module, and activate virtual environment, which is named “myvenv” in the following:\n\nNOTE: A shared environment does not exist in for SLURM_BRIDGE in order to support logging for each user/bridge\n\npython3 -m venv <myvenv> \nmodule unload python/3.8.4 \nsource ./<myvenv>/bin/activate \n\nNOTE: The following step is only needed when a new idmtools Singularity image is available and you’ve previously installed packages in your home directory. This cleans up local packages from previous installations inside Singularity container\n\nrm –fr ~/.local/lib/python* \nInstall the idmtools slurm utils package:\npip3 install idmtools-slurm-utils -i https://packages.idmod.org/api/pypi/pypi-production/simple \nRun the agent for SLURM_BRIDGE in background\nidmtools-slurm-bridge & \nLaunch the terminal within the Singularity container\n\nNOTE: emodpy-malaria_2.4.3e.sif is the current image but is subject to change as updates are made\nAfter launching, you will see the Singularity prompt in the terminal, Singularity>, from which you can run pip3 list to show the available Singularity container packages, including emodpy-malaria.\n\nsingularity exec emodpy-malaria_2.4.3e.sif bash\n\n#OR\n\nsingularity shell emodpy-malaria_2.4.3e.sif\n\n\n\n\nNOTE: A shared environment exists in /projects/b1139/environments/emodpy_alt for SLURM_LOCAL\n\nAlternatively, you can install everything through a virtual environment. Create a Python virtual environment and activate (see step 2 above in Preferred Install)\npip3 install emodpy-malaria --index-url=https://packages.idmod.org/api/pypi/pypi-production/simple \n\npip3 install idmtools_platform_slurm --index-url=https://packages.idmod.org/api/pypi/pypi-production/simple\n\n\ncurrently need to also run the following to download the newest version of emodpy (in development) and overwrite the one that comes with emodpy-malaria:\npip3 install emodpy==1.21.0.dev0 --index-url=https://packages.idmod.org/api/pypi/pypi-production/simple --no-cache-dir --pre\n\n\nDuring installation of the shared venv on b1139, some issues arose that cause the installation to quit unexpectedly. This is seemingly an issue with access to the libgit2 module to build the pygit wheel. Libgit2 was installed within the emodpy_alt venv folder using these instructions. As it is now available, installation should hopefully avoid these issues in the future but it could occur with personal venvs (if team members choose to create their own environments).\n\nNOTE: The above installation instructions are for emodpy-malaria, which includes installing idmtools and other dependencies by referencing the requirements.txt when using pip install. For more information on requirements.txt and pip install, see https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtual-environments/#using-requirements-files\nNOTE: IDM prefers us to use the bridged mode; however, local will work better with multiple login nodes and team venv sharing"

    "text": "⚠️ How-To: report on broadcast events that occur during simulations\nEMOD is capable of tracking a variety of built-in events as well as custom campaign events. Custom events can be particularly useful for explicitly tracking and counting the number of interventions distributed. For example, in the simple SMC intervention (see How-To on drug campaigns) we defined an event called 'Received_SMC' to describe children who actually received SMC drugs in the simulation. The add_health_seeking function automatically generates a 'Received_Treatment' event for each individual receiving treatment for symptomatic malaria. Adding custom events to the config parameter 'Custom_Individual_Events' is handled automatically.\n\nReportEventCounter\nTo track how many events are occurring each day, request ReportEventCounter and specify the list of events you would like to track:\n# Example\nThis generates a ReportEventCounter.json file that reports that total number of events in each day of the simulation. Reporting a subset of node IDs, restricting on age, and restricing on individual property are all configurable. The format of the .json is identical to InsetChart.json, so analyzers written for InsetChart.json can be easily adapted for ReportEventCounter.\n\n\nReportEventRecorder\nSometimes you may want to track individual-level events. To do so, we use ReportEventRecorder, which is similar to ReportEventCounter but lists each event as it occurs and provides information about the person experiencing the event.\n\nUpdate configuration parameters\n#Example\n\nThere are additional optional parameters that you can specify to refine your report: see full list here. This can help reduce file sizes and speed up processing if you know you’ll only a subset of the simulation data.\nAfter running, a file called ReportEventRecorder.csv will be generated in the output/ folder for the simulation. Each row of the report represents a distinct event, with the following information in its columns:\n\nEvent Details:\n\nTime (when did event occur)\nNode_ID (where did event occur)\nEvent_Name (what happened)\n\nIndividual Details (who did it happen to?):\n\nIndividual_ID\nAge\nGender\nInfected (1 = True)\nInfectiousness\nRelativeBitingRate\nTrueParasiteDensity\nTrueGametocyteDensity\nPlus an additional column for the value of each additional Individual Property included in the 'Report_Event_Recorder_Individual_Properties' list."

It is not a test but rather the first component of the technical program, through which we develop these skills alongside more advanced modeling techniques.\nThe first assignment asks you to demonstrate your ability to use the pre-requisite skills to:\n1. Use python to “analyze” (process, clean, and merge) data from multiple files to produce a single output spreadsheet.\n2. Use R to wrangle, summarize, and plot the cleaned output data from Part 1.\nThis assignment is due at the end of Week 0.\nStuck?\n\nReview the tutorials in the table above\n\nPost on the FE-2023 Slack Channel\n\nWe will hold (virtual) Office Hours in Week 0 to answer questions and help out!\n\n\n\nInstructions\n\nPart 0. Get a copy of the example data\n\nGo to the coding assignment repository\nObtain a local copy of the example_data/ folder\n\nDownload and unzip the folder to a new folder on your computer, …/project_dir\n\nExamine a sample output.csv file from the example data.\nYou will have to click through experiment > simulation_## > outputs to see one. This is a standard directory structure for outputs from the model, EMOD, which you will soon become very familiar with!\n\nIn reality, the output files in EMOD can be .json dictionaries or .bin binary files in addition to .csv spreadsheets. However, to make the assignment simpler, we’ve created some “fake” output files in a form that is easier to work with.\n\nEach output.csv file contains daily timeseries of 3 dependent variables [Var1, Var2, and Var3] for a specific combination of the grouping variables [Site, Trial_Number, and Arm]\n\n\n\n\nPart 1. Python - analyze example data\n\nCreate a new my_python_script.py file in the same /project_dir where you saved the example_data folder\nYour directory structure should be:\n\nproject_dir/\n\nexample_data/\n\n…\n\n\nmy_python_script.py\n\n\nImport the following modules: pandas, numpy, os\nCombine data from the output.csv file in each example_data/simulation/ sub-folder into a single DataFrame, with the following modifications:\n\nKeep all grouping variables (“Day”, “Site”, “Trial_Number”, and “Arm”)\n\nRestrict to include only values in the last 365 Days\n\nSave the values for “Var1” and “Var3” in each group\n\nDo not save the values for any other variables that may have been in output.csv !\n\n\nAppend results from all simulations together.\n\nSave the resulting DataFrame as output_cleaned.csv\n\n\n\nPart 2. R - transform and visualize output\nDid you generate the output from Part 1?\nThis must be done before starting Part 2.\nYour directory structure should now be:\n\nproject_dir/\n\nexample_data/\n\n…\n\n\nmy_python_script.py\n\noutput_cleaned.csv\n\n\n\nOpen Rstudio: File > New Project > Existing Directory > project_dir\nCreate a new my_R_script.Rmd file or my_R_script.R script inside project_dir to do the following:\n\nRead in output_cleaned.csv\nAggregate the count, mean, and standard deviation of Var1 and Var3 (separately) on each day for a given Site\n\nThis will collapse all Trial_Numbers and Arms together\n\nUse mutate to add upper and lower 95% prediction intervals around the daily mean of Var1 and Var3 at each Site\n\nmean ± 1.96 * sd ÷ √n\n\nUse ggplot2 to produce plots of the data:\n\nDay on the x-axis, Var# on the y-axis\nSeparate lines and colors for each dependent variable (Var 1 and Var 3)\nSeparate facets for each Site\nAn informative title, labels, legend, color palette etc.\n\nYou don’t need to spend much time on plot appearance for this for this assignment, but it is an important part of communicating our findings\n\n\nSave your plot(s) as .png file(s) in project_dir/ with a descriptive file name (ex. “Variables1-2_by_Site.png”)\n\n\n\n\nPart 3. Submit to Slack\nPost your plot(s) to the FE-2023 slack channel for feedback.\n\nHow does it compare to others?\n\nIf something looks off, what do you think is causing it?\n\nFor more practice: Try creating the plots using different grouping variables (Ex. Trial_Number, or Arm) in addition to or instead of Site"

    "text": "Expectations for participating in Journal Club as a leader or discussant\n\nObjectives of the applied modeling journal club\nThrough reading and discussing this series of papers, program participants will be introduced to the field of applied malaria modeling. Participants will see past applications of EMOD as well as a few other individual-based models that have been used to inform policy. The chosen papers reflect a wide range of topics such that participants will be exposed to different model capabilities.\nEven if a particular paper is of limited relevance to someone’s project, each paper and discussion is an opportunity to practice critical reading. Where did the model do well? What were its limitations? Was the approach rigorous? Did the results make sense, and were they presented clearly? Was the model fit for purpose? These are all questions we need to ask of ourselves in our own applied modeling work. Journal Club lets us practice thinking through how to answer these questions together.\n\n\nGuidance for leaders\nJournal club leaders are expected to be able to walk discussants through the paper, explaining the following on the content of the paper:\n\nMotivation for the work\n\nApproach used\n\nWalk through each figure, including methods and results\n\nMain conclusions\n\nJournal club leaders should also have prepared their own thoughts on the analysis of the paper:\n\nStrengths and limitations of the model\n\nTo what extent the conclusions are supported by the results\n\nWhat further evidence would support the modeling results\n\nWhat would be other interesting questions to ask, using either the approach in the paper or other approaches (modeling or not)\n\n\nBefore\n\nRead the assigned paper at least 3 days prior to the session\nPrepare answers to the content and analysis points above and note anything confusing\nDiscuss answers with buddy and clarify points of confusion\n\n\n\nDuring\n\nLead everyone through reviewing the content of the paper, making sure everyone understood what was done and why\nLead everyone through a discussion of the analysis of the paper, covering each of the analysis points listed above, and bringing in new questions and ideas\nManage the discussion so everyone contributes and no one dominates\nManage the overall pace such that the entirety of the paper and the discussion points are covered\n\n\n\nAfter\n\nFollow up on any questions raised during the discussion that could not be answered at the time\n\n\n\n\nGuidance for discussants\n\nBefore\n\nRead the assigned paper prior to attending the journal club session\nMake notes and mark any questions you may have to discuss with the group\n\n\n\nDuring\n\nBe an active participant so we can all learn from each other’s ideas\nIf you have a question, others will too.

It keeps us from losing track of our code if we overwrite a file or want to revert to an older version of a script. Every version of our code that has been committed and pushed can be retrieved if lost or overwritten. Code that has not been committed and push cannot be retrieved.\n2. Sharing our code lets us learn from each other and reuse code developed by other team members. If your repository is private, your code is only visible to those with whom you have explicitly shared it.\nGit can be tricky and we’ve all had to deal with git problems. Please don’t hesitate to ask for help on Slack (#help) or search the web as there are many existing resources, such as this tutorial from GitHub.

You may use this time as you see fit but it is recommended that you discuss any problems you may be encountering in your work, results, next steps, and other questions. You and your assigned buddy will discuss any additional expectations during your first sessions to make the best use of this time.\n\n\nMeetings with Jaline\nWeekly 1-on-1 meetings will also be held with Jaline to discuss project progress, ideas, and needs. This meeting will be similar to buddy 1-on-1s and sometimes may be held together as a 2-on-1 to ensure that you are getting the best support possible throughout the program and everyone is on the same page. It is your responsibility to make the most of your meetings with Jaline, which includes being prepared with what you would like to discuss.\n\nJaline’s meeting policy:\nIn general, I have an open-door policy. If my office door is open, I am happy to answer questions or talk about your work—if I don’t want to be disturbed, I will close my door. Please ping me on Slack at any time and I will respond as soon as I can. However, I am not always available, so if there is something important that will take a substantial time to discuss, it is best to schedule a meeting with me.\nWhat should you bring to a meeting with me? It is your job to make the most of this time and usually that means coming in with a list of what you’d like to talk about. Here is what we will generally cover:\nWhat you have done: Generally I prefer that you keep me/the group aware of new analyses via Slack. But the 1-on-1 is also a good time to talk over interesting results or roadblocks:\n\nWhat analyses have you done since the last time we met? I want to see all your new results, analyzed and in pretty graphs. We may also take a deeper dive to look at individual results or brainstorm new analyses, so bring that with you.\n\nIf you don’t have results, why not? What roadblocks are you facing and how are you working through them? What analyses or simulations are in progress?\n\n\nHow are writing projects coming along?\n\nI am asking for this information not to evaluate if you are working hard enough, but to see how your project is progressing.\nIdeas: what do your results mean? What should we do next? Do we have what we need to do it?\nWhat do you need from me? This is the time to let me know if you need a signature, a letter of recommendation, a progress report, extra compute resources, or new software.\nAnything pertinent to your professional development or well-being. Are you progressing towards your goals for the program? If there are any issues in or outside of the workplace that may hinder your progress, this is a time to talk about it.\nI strongly recommend you keep a log of your weekly 1-on-1’s, noting what was discussed and any next steps you’re planning to do."

I expect cooperation from all members to help ensure a safe environment for everybody. This team is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, or religion (or lack thereof). We do not tolerate harassment of team members in any form. Harassment can include offensive verbal comments, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention. Members asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately. We expect members to follow these guidelines in all in person, phone, online communication, team-related events, university events, conferences, etc. If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact Jaline immediately. Please note that Jaline is a mandatory reporter, this means that she is required to report sexual misconduct to the Title IX office and may not be able to guarantee confidentiality.\n\n\nEthical conduct of research\nI expect team members to be honest in scientific communications both within and outside the team. I expect that credit will be given where credit is due, including in scientific writing. It is never okay to tamper with data, make up data, omit data, or fudge results in any way, and this will not be tolerated. Science is about finding out the truth, not about fitting a hypothesis or data that looks pretty. My goal is for our team to have a reputation for performing impeccably rigorous science in an open and transparent way.\n\n\nCulture of engagement and professional critique\nWe would like to foster a highly engaged research environment where everyone is included in discussions and professional critique is welcome. You are expected to think critically about your own work as well as others’ work, and to express your questions and opinions politely and professionally. Our aim for your time with the team is to grow your independence and for everyone to do great work — we are stronger when we give each other feedback and seriously consider each other’s suggestions. This includes giving me feedback on what you think I can do better and pointing out my blind spots. I will not penalize you for disagreeing with me but will be glad you’re speaking up.\n\n\nCulture of teamwork\nWe work on an incredibly important health problem that affects millions of people, and the faster we can work the sooner we can have a positive impact. This means that I don’t want you to spend weeks bashing your head against a problem if talking to someone else would mean it gets resolved more quickly. Think about where you add the most value: is it building software? Designing experiments? Thinking about science? Communicating with our partners? Lean into your strengths and let the team help you with other aspects of your work."

    "title": "Intro to Git (2022)",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Git is a popular version control software to manage codes, especially in a collaborative environment.\nHere is a comic from “Piled Higher and Deeper” by Jorge Cham regarding version control:\n Git allows us to make changes to our code, and say if we didn’t like the changes, we can always go back to the older versions of the code. In a collaborative environment, our colleagues can make changes to our codes, and we can track who’s made what changes to the code, and undo it if necessary. If all of these sounds familiar, yes it does feel like we that track changes function in say Microsoft Word, or the version control function available in Dropbox. The difference is that you can designate a folder as your “Git repository”, and you decide which file inside this folder get version controlled.\nWhile Git is a software that lives inside your computer, GitHub is an internet hosting provider that can host your Git repository. For example, a git repository containing the dtk-tools Python package is hosted on GitHub. This package is important for us to use EMOD, and is developed by IDM. To obtain the package, we can (1) get granted access to the repository that lives in GitHub, and (2) “clone” the package from GitHub to our local computer. We can then look into the package and find out who has made what changes to the source code of the package. This has made it very easy for coding projects and packages to be shared to others.\nGit can get complicated and difficult to use at times… However, in this section, we focus only on the simple steps of getting the packages to your computer.\n\nThings you’ll need\n\nInstall GitHub Desktop\nGet a GitHub account if you don’t already have.\nGet the access to the repository dtk-tools and dtk-tools-malaria if you don’t already have them\n\n\n\nGitHub Desktop\nThis is an app that provides graphic user interface to GitHub. Note that you do not necessarily need to use this app to interface with Git or GitHub. There are other app such as Sourcetree or commandline that does similar and wonderful job. However for this tutorial, we use GitHub Desktop because it’s easier to set things up.\nTo “download” the package, we “Clone repository” from GitHub, which can be access from “File” at the top bar. If you already connected your GitHub account to the app, you should be able to choose the dtk-tools repository in the pop-up window. Then you would specify a “Local path” of your choice (you do not need to add “dtk-tools” to that path.) When you click “Clone”, the app would download the package into a folder called dtk-tools and put it onto the path you specified.\nDo the same thing for dtk-tools-malaria!\n\n\nMore Git?\nOf course, there are more to git than what we have just done. During the tutorial, some of the basic function of git, such as commit, push and pull will be demonstrated. These functions will be important when you start developing your own project. Depending on what software you use to code (e.g., PyCharm, VS Code), git functions are often incorporated into them already, so the experience is bound to be slightly different.\nIf you’re planning to use git through command line (e.g., Powershell, Bash etc.) then this is a good tutorial for you to learn more about git."

Often we have maps showing values for each pixels, for example, ITN access and usage map with 5km x 5km resolutions or Population counts with 1km x 1km resolutions. To convert these maps to useful estimates for our model, we need to extract the values underlying each pixel in the map, within the geographical area of interest. For example, if the map covers the entire Sub-Saharan Africa, and all we need is values from Burkina Faso, we will need to only extract the pixels within the country’s boundary. Then we would need to aggregate the values of the pixels, to obtain some form of country-wide estimate. Similar analogy is applicable to region, district and province.\nWe use the sp and raster packages in R to achieve this. For the first example, we will walk through extracting ITN usage estimate for a Burkina Faso district of Kampti."

There are a little misalignment in the north for this raster, but for our purpose, this problem is not too big.\n\nplot(pop_raster)\nplot(shp, add=T)\n\n\n\n\n\nNaïve Extraction\nThe most naïve way of extracting values for each district here is to directly use the extract() function. When supplied with a set of polygons (shapes), the function pull the values underlying all the pixels within the shapes, and aggregate them, say by taking means. The function can be supplied by a set of points too.\n\ndf <- shp@data # Pull data out of shapefiles (District names etc.)\n\n# Extract and aggregate using mean function\ndf$itn_cov <- extract(itn_raster, shp, fun=mean)\n\n# Look at values for Bittou district\ndf[df$NOMDEP=='BITTOU', c('NOMDEP', 'NOMREGION', 'itn_cov')]\n\n   NOMDEP  NOMREGION   itn_cov\n53 BITTOU CENTRE-EST 0.7512201\n\n\n\n\nPopulation-weighted extraction\nSometimes averaging each pixel without weights doesn’t feel quite “right”: Pixels inside uninhabited forests aren’t the same as pixels inside a crowded town when we care about ITN coverage. Therefore, we may elect to use population map to weight the pixels and obtain a population-weighted estimate for each district.\n\n# First try to stack the ITN and Population map\n## To do so, need to ensure two maps cover same area\n## Crop ITN raster according to Population raster\nitn_raster_cr <- crop(itn_raster, pop_raster)\n## Lower resolution of Population raster to the level of ITN raster\npop_raster_res <- resample(pop_raster, itn_raster_cr, )\n\n## Stacking the raster\nitn_pop_stack <- stack(itn_raster_cr, pop_raster_res)\n\n# Extract the raster stack according to the shapes, no aggregation\nout <- extract(itn_pop_stack, shp)\n\n# Define functions to calculate weighted average from output matrix\nweighted_avg <- function (x, w) sum(x * w) / sum(w)\nestim_from_matrix <- function (mat) {\n  mat <- na.omit(mat)\n  return(weighted_avg(mat[,1], mat[,2]))\n}\n\nWithout specifying the aggregating function for extract(), the function pull every single pixel out of the raster stack. Result is a list of matrices, first column is ITN coverage, second column is population count. So we define a function estim_from_matrix() that would calculate weighted average of first column according to second column. sapply() applies the function to each element (matrix) of the list, and combine the output nicely into a vector.\n\ndf2 <- shp@data\ndf2$itn_cov <- sapply(out, estim_from_matrix)\n\ndf2[df2$NOMDEP=='BITTOU', c('NOMDEP', 'NOMREGION', 'itn_cov')]\n\n   NOMDEP  NOMREGION   itn_cov\n53 BITTOU CENTRE-EST 0.7475682\n\n\nThe ITN coverage estimates from population-weighted method is almost the same as the naive method. This is potentially due to the ITN estimates within the district being relatively homogeneous."
