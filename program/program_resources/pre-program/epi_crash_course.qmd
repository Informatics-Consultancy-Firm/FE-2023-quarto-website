Make sure you're familiar with these fundamental concepts of malaria epidemiology 

### Crash Course Objectives

During Week 0, we will host a malaria epidemiology crash course, focused on these learning objectives:  

* Describe malaria pathogenesis and disease burden metrics in humans  
* Describe factors that affect the disease burden, including impact of interventions and host factors such as age and immunity  
* Overview of epidemiological methods for measuring malaria morbidity and mortality and how information can be collected  
* Identify examples of error, bias, confounding, and validity in malaria studies  
* Describe the life-cycle of human malaria parasites, key stages, and their relevance to transmission and control  
* Relate the parasite life cycle to pathogenesis, immune responses, and interventions  
* Describe the life- and feeding cycle of malaria vectors

### Pre-Requisites

The crash course in Week 0 will assume familiarity with certain concepts from these review resources:

[StatPearls - Epidemiology of Study Design](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK470342/)  

* Observational vs. Cohort vs. Experimental Studies

[CDC Principles of Epidemiology in Public Health Practice](https://www.cdc.gov/csels/dsepd/ss1978/SS1978.pdf)

* Lesson One: Intro to Epidemiology  
  * Key features and applications of descriptive & analytic epidemiology\
* Lesson Two: Summarizing Data  
  * Calculating and interpreting mean, median, mode, ranges, variance, standard deviation, and confidence intervals\
* Lesson Three: Measures of Risk  
  * Calculating and interpreting ratios, proportions, incidence rates, mortality rates, prevalence, and years of potential life lost
