Experiment design, inputs/outputs, diagnostics plots, and QUEST

### Experiment design

### Reviewing input & output files

### Diagnostic plots

### QUEST etiquette

QUEST computing resources are finite and shared. 

* Check with others before running large or long jobs
* Do *not* run more than 100 jobs simultaneously on b1139
* Test and debug simulations with small jobs (minimal sweeping, duration, etc.) before exapnding to full sets
* [Managing disk space]()
